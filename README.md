### About Our Team
Every Texan is known for practical, data-driven policy solutions. We use high-quality data collected from credible sources, analyzed by our team of experts. We explore data for potential solutions to everyday problems â€” and we make that data accessible to everyone, from policymakers to concerned Texans.
